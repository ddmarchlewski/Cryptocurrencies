# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an analysis for people who want to get into the cryptocurrency market. We are asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Results
First, I needed to find the total number of tradable cryptocurrencies. After cleaning up the data, I was able to find out that there were 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.

Then, I made a 3D graph. This graph shows all of the currencies. The points show the name of the currency.
